Today I reset my [wordpress](johnsonellis.xyz) website. It had one old project from a few years ago on it but I wanted a fresh start.
It is currently a very empty website, I have a photographer friend who has agreed to do some professional headshots for me, and I have the recap of the book "Programming skills for Data Science" that I wrote as I was working through that book.
I find wordpress a bit fiddly but having a web prescence is something I want to have when it's time to start job-hunting!
