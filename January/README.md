Today I reset my [wordpress](johnsonellis.xyz) website. It had one old project from a few years ago on it but I wanted a fresh start.
It is currently a very empty website, I have a photographer friend who has agreed to do some professional headshots for me, and I have the recap of the book "Programming skills for Data Science" that I wrote as I was working through that book.
I find wordpress a bit fiddly but having a web prescence is something I want to have when it's time to start job-hunting!

I have a few ongoing tasks to juggle at the moment, I've learned that I have a tendancy to dive deep into a topic, burn through it really quickly, then get bored of it and not touch it again for ages. To combat this I have decided to have a few different things to work on during my productive time:
1) Udemy Course - Algorithmic Trading A-Z with Python, Machine Learning and AWS
2) Book - Python Crash Course (General programming skills)
3) Book - Programming Collective Intelligence (Machine Learning related skills)
4) Project - Use R to tell a story about data (Make some use from that other book I read!)
5) Open University Access Module
As I am self-studying, I don't really have deadlines for specific projects, it's up to me to decide what I want to focus on, what I find valuable, what skills I want to develop and showcase etc. etc.

So far in the Udemy course it's the very basic info like:
- How do I open an account with a broker?
- What is an API?
- What is margin?
- How do I do a trade?
- What are candlesticks
- What is a derivative?
- How do I calculate profit and loss?

Personally I'm already familiar with day trading so this is not too interesting to me.

Today I wrangled with wordpress some more but I think I've just about got it set up how I want.
Each _post_ will be part of a _category_. As data science encompasses maths and programming skills I think I may as well lump everything under a "Work" category.
I've also decided to post about my current hobby, Warhammer 40,000 as I'd like to look back and see how I improve at painting over time.

Today I set up the OANDA trading applications, the desktop client worked fine but the Metatrader4 client I believe needs to be activated by the broker. I set up an OANDA and FXCM account about a month ago and didn't use them as I was focused on working through a book - I've sent my account manager an email and hopefully they can help me get it working within a couple of days.
I also made a blog post, personally I'm not a fan of social media so I may do a weekly LinkedIn post when I'm more up and running study-wise, I am aware that recruiters love an active LinkedIn.

I've also got Jupyter notebooks up and running, I used them for a while back when I was on the Strive data science bootcamp so nothing new to me, the udemy course may be making a lot of use for them but I'll probably use PyCharm for my code as I'm fine with IDEs.

Today I finished the book "Humble Pi" by Matt Parker, it is a collection of famous maths errors through history and was an enjoyable read - it's interesting how various errors come about and serves as a reminder that mistakes happen, the best practice is to build systems with enough checks and verification that the mistakes get caught and fixed before disaster!

First day of the new week and the udemy course is finally starting to get interesting!
Today I have generated an API key and used it to grab our account data and a list of available instruments, nothing groundbreaking but this is after setting up the conda environment and jupyter notebook support for PyCharm.
I've started reading the book "Thinking fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman, I'm about 4 chapters in and it's so far a very enjoyable read!

Today on the Udemy course I have learned how to open trades via the API, during testing I ended up with about 10 open orders for 1,000 units of EUR/USD, good thing this isn't real money yet! I'm glad the course has started to pick up, I've been watching most of the videos on 1.5x speed as, rightly so, the instructor has to lay out the fundamentals before we can advance. Mainly things like how to ask for help, check the FAQ, learn to debug, google things first etc.

Today I had a little refresher of markdown syntax, I think familiarity is the name of the game in terms of productively using things like markdown, vim, terminal commands etc. Tools that require a bit of learning but once skilled in using them allow you to do so much so quickly. I am considering buying a new laptop for my Open Univeristy studies (currently using one of the famed Lenovo thinkpads) and I think I do want to force myself to use an arch based distro (Arco, Garuda, EndeavourOS being my top choices) as personally I do enjoy the learning experience of getting to grips with different operating systems, seeing how they differ from one another etc.

The udemy course recommends making sure that you are familiar with the basics of python, pandas, and financial information - it also provides 3 appendices with plenty of exercises and information to make sure you are up to speed on everything you need to know. There is a large overlap currently with this and the "python crash course" book I have, so I'm currently finding the the subject a bit tedious, but it is important for me to slog through it so that I don't suddenly become overwhelmed later due to missing out a key topic somewhere!
