Today I reset my [wordpress](johnsonellis.xyz) website. It had one old project from a few years ago on it but I wanted a fresh start.
It is currently a very empty website, I have a photographer friend who has agreed to do some professional headshots for me, and I have the recap of the book "Programming skills for Data Science" that I wrote as I was working through that book.
I find wordpress a bit fiddly but having a web prescence is something I want to have when it's time to start job-hunting!

I have a few ongoing tasks to juggle at the moment, I've learned that I have a tendancy to dive deep into a topic, burn through it really quickly, then get bored of it and not touch it again for ages. To combat this I have decided to have a few different things to work on during my productive time:
1) Udemy Course - Algorithmic Trading A-Z with Python, Machine Learning and AWS
2) Book - Python Crash Course (General programming skills)
3) Book - Programming Collective Intelligence (Machine Learning related skills)
4) Project - Use R to tell a story about data (Make some use from that other book I read!)
5) Open University Access Module
As I am self-studying, I don't really have deadlines for specific projects, it's up to me to decide what I want to focus on, what I find valuable, what skills I want to develop and showcase etc. etc.

So far in the Udemy course it's the very basic info like:
- How do I open an account with a broker?
- What is an API?
- What is margin?
- How do I do a trade?
- What are candlesticks
- What is a derivative?
- How do I calculate profit and loss?

Personally I'm already familiar with day trading so this is not too interesting to me.

Today I wrangled with wordpress some more but I think I've just about got it set up how I want.
Each _post_ will be part of a _category_. As data science encompasses maths and programming skills I think I may as well lump everything under a "Work" category.
I've also decided to post about my current hobby, Warhammer 40,000 as I'd like to look back and see how I improve at painting over time.

Today I set up the OANDA trading applications, the desktop client worked fine but the Metatrader4 client I believe needs to be activated by the broker. I set up an OANDA and FXCM account about a month ago and didn't use them as I was focused on working through a book - I've sent my account manager an email and hopefully they can help me get it working within a couple of days.
I also made a blog post, personally I'm not a fan of social media so I may do a weekly LinkedIn post when I'm more up and running study-wise, I am aware that recruiters love an active LinkedIn.

I've also got Jupyter notebooks up and running, I used them for a while back when I was on the Strive data science bootcamp so nothing new to me, the udemy course may be making a lot of use for them but I'll probably use PyCharm for my code as I'm fine with IDEs.
